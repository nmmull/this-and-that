<p>
The goal of this part of the seminar is to "do" some reverse
mathematics. This isn't so different from doing "normal" mathematics,
except that you have one hand tied behind your back, so to speak:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We can't just "do" induction or comprehension whenever we want.
Subsystems of second order arithmetic have restricted induction and
comprehension principles, and we need to make sure we respect these
restrictions.</li>
<li>We can't construct any mathematical structures we want.  We have to
make sure all the structures we want to work with are <i>encodable</i>
within second-order arithmetic.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Doing reverse mathematics is also about meta-theory:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>reversals, i.e., proving axioms from theorems;</li>
<li>separations, i.e., showing that an axiom doesn't follow from the
others.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is a lot, and not really all that reasonable to cover in two
hour-long sessions, but to get a <i>taste</i> of all of these components,
I'd like to look at a particular reversal:<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Weak König's Lemma (WKL) is equivalent to Lindenbaum's Lemma (LL)
with respect to computable mathematics (RCA₀).</i>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We'll begin with an informal presentation of this reversal (i.e., in
"normal" mathematics) and then look at what needs to be done to make
this a formal theorem of the meta-theory of RCA₀, the subsystem of
second-order arithmetic that captures doing mathematics in the world
where all sets are computable.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge1c6311">
<p>
Weak König's Lemma (WKL) is a fairly intuitive set-theoretic result
about infinite binary trees.
</p>

<p>
<b>Lemma.</b> (WLK) Every infinite binary tree has an infinite path.
</p>

<p>
<i>Proof sketch.</i> (in "normal" mathematics) Suppose we're given an
infinite binary tree 𝑇.  Because 𝑇 is infinite, it must have a left
subtree 𝑇₀ or a right subtree 𝑇₁. If it has both, then one of these
two subtrees is infinite.  Without loss of generality, let's say the
left subtree 𝑇₀ is infinite. By induction, 𝑇₀ has an infinite path 𝑃
(since 𝑇₀ is an infinite binary tree). Therefore, therefore 0𝑃 (i.e.,
the path 𝑃 with 0 concatenated to the front) is an infinite path in
𝑇. ∎
</p>

<p>
A key feature of this proof: <i>in order to extend the path we're
building, we need to reason about whether or not a binary tree is
infinite</i>. That is, if we're given choice between 𝒯₀ and 𝒯₁, we have
to be able to choose one that's infinite.  We'll come back to
this. First, in order to aid what follows, we'll make WKL a bit more
formal.
</p>

<p>
<b>Definition.</b> Let 𝑏₁, 𝑏₂ ∈ {0, 1}* be finite binary strings. We say 𝑏₁
is an <b>initial segment</b> of 𝑏₂, written 𝑏₁ ≺ 𝑏₂, if there is a binary
string 𝑐 such that 𝑏₁𝑐 = 𝑏₂.  For example, 01100 is an initial segment
of 011000110.
</p>

<p>
<b>Definition.</b> A <b>tree</b> is a set 𝑇 ⊂ {0, 1}* which is closed under
initial segments, i.e., if 𝑏 ∈ 𝑇 and 𝑐 ≺ 𝑏 then 𝑐 ∈ 𝑇.
</p>

<p>
<b>Definition.</b> A <b>path</b> is a function 𝑃 : ℕ → {0, 1} such that
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
𝑃(0) 𝑃(1) &#x2026; 𝑃(𝑘 - 1) ∈ 𝑇
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
for every 𝑘 ∈ ℕ.
</p>


<p>
<i>Proof sketch.</i> (WKL, slightly more formal) let 𝑇 be an infinite
binary tree.  Define 𝑇₀ = { 𝑏 : 0𝑏 ∈ 𝑇 } and 𝑇₁ = { 𝑏 : 1𝑏 ∈ 𝑇 }. Note
that both 𝑇₀ and 𝑇₁ are binary trees. And since 𝑇 is infinite, 𝑇₀ or
𝑇₁ is infinite.  Suppose without loss of generality that 𝑇₀ is
infinite.  By induction, there is a path 𝑃′ in 𝑇₀. Define 𝑃(0) = 0
and, for 𝑖 ∈ ℕ⁺, 𝑃(𝑖 + 1) = 𝑃′(𝑖). Then 𝑃 is a path in 𝑇. ∎
</p>

<p>
Next up, Lindenbaum's lemma (LL).
</p>

<p>
<b>Definition.</b> A <b>completion</b> of a theory 𝒯 is a theory 𝒯* ⊃ 𝒯 which is
consistent:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
∄ϕ . 𝒯 ⊢ ϕ and 𝒯 ⊢ ¬ϕ
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
complete:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
∀ ϕ . 𝒯 ⊢ ϕ or 𝒯 ⊢ ¬ϕ
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
and closed under logical consequence.
</p>

<p>
<b>Lemma.</b> (LL) Every consistent theory has a completion.
</p>

<p>
<i>Proof sketch.</i> We might already see that this lemma has a
similar flavor to WKL, so let's use WKL to prove it.
</p>

<p>
Let 𝒯 be a consistent theory and let ϕ₀, ϕ₁,&#x2026; be an enumeration of
the sentences in our language.
</p>

<p>
Our approach is to build a binary tree in which each branch is a
decision as to whether we should add a given sentence ϕ or its
negation ¬ϕ to 𝒯.  An infinite path then represents a choice for all
sentences, giving us a completion.
</p>

<p>
Now let's fix some notation: we'll write ϕ[0] for ¬ϕ and ϕ[1]
for ϕ. For a binary string 𝑏 ∈ {0, 1}ᵏ, we can consider the theory
</p>

<p>
𝒯[𝑏] = 𝒯 + ϕ₀[𝑏(1)] + ϕ₁[𝑏(1)] + &#x2026; + ϕₖ[𝑏(𝑘)]
</p>

<p>
Define the set 𝑇 = { 𝑏 : 𝒯[𝑏] is consistent }. This is an infinite
binary tree (you may need to think about this for a second), so by WKL
it has a path 𝑃. The set { ϕᵢ[𝑃(i)] : i ∈ ℕ } is a completion of 𝒯. ∎
</p>

<p>
There's a fair amount of mathematical symbology in the above proof,
but it basically says: <i>WKL gives us a way of choosing which sentences
to add to our completion.</i> And in the same way that proving WKL
requires us to determine which of two trees is infinite, proving LL
requires us to determine which of two theories is consistent.
</p>

<p>
Now, for the main event of this section, the reversal.
</p>

<p>
<b>Theorem.</b> LL implies WLK.
</p>

<p>
<i>Proof sketch.</i> Proving a reversal often comes down to a trick, or a
"gadget." In this case, we need to define a theory whose completion
defines a path through a given tree 𝑇.
</p>

<p>
We work over a theory with nullary relations (i.e., constants) of the
form 𝐿₀, 𝐿₁, &#x2026;  We think of 𝐿ᵢ as "go left at the 𝑖th level." That
way, if we get a completion 𝒯* of a theory 𝒯, we can read off a path 𝑃
as
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
𝑃(i) = 𝟙[𝐿ᵢ ∈ 𝒯*]
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
That is, a completion is forced to choose a path (because it can't
prove both 𝐿ᵢ and ¬𝐿ᵢ, but it must prove one of them).
</p>

<p>
It then comes down making sure that these choices "keep us in the
tree." The trick: our theory describes where <i>not</i> to go to find an
infinite path.
</p>

<p>
Let 𝑏 ∈ {0, 1}ᵏ be a binary string <i>not</i> in 𝑇 and define the sentence:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
ψ[𝑏] = ¬(𝐿₀[𝑏(0)] ∧ 𝐿₁[𝑏(1)] ∧ &#x2026; ∧ 𝐿ₖ[𝑏(𝑘)])
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This sentences encodes the statement "don't go down a path which
starts with 𝑏."  We then define the theory
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
𝒯 = { ψ[𝑏] : 𝑏 ∉ 𝑇 }
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
This is a consistent theory (you may need to think about this for a
second) so by LL it has a completion 𝒯*. We can define the function
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
𝑃(𝑖) = 𝟙[𝐿ᵢ ∈ 𝒯*]
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Consider the binary string 𝑃(0) &#x2026; 𝑃(𝑘). By definition of 𝑃,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
𝒯* ⊢ 𝐿₀[P(0)] ∧ &#x2026; ∧ 𝐿ₖ[P(𝑘)]
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If 𝑃(0) &#x2026; 𝑃(𝑘) ∉ 𝑇 then, by definition of 𝒯,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
𝒯* ⊢ ¬(𝐿₀[P(0)] ∧ &#x2026; ∧ 𝐿ₖ[P(𝑘)])
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
contradicting consistency. Therefore, implies 𝑃(0) &#x2026; 𝑃(𝑘) ∈ 𝑇. Since
𝑘 was arbitrary, it follows that 𝑃 is a path in 𝑇. ∎
</p>

<p>
Part of the point here is that 𝑇 may have many paths, but we don't
necessarily have a way of finding them.  The theory we defined
says where <i>not</i> to go, but doesn't give us a way of choosing
an actual path. Applying LL <i>forces</i> a choice.
</p>

<p>
All this tells us that WKL and LL are, in some sense, logically
equivalent. Denis Hirschfeldt says that WKL is the "combinatorial
core" of LL; it acts like roadmap for what's "actually going on" in
the proof.  And what amazing─what reverse mathematics tells us─is
that this roadmap is shared by <i>many</i> theorems, about compactness in
the topological sense, about completeness in the logical sense, about
properties of continuous functions, etc., etc.
</p>

<p>
But there's one aspect of what we've done so far that's <i>very</i>
unsatisfying from a mathematical perspective: <i>WKL and LL are already
theorems of "normal" mathematics.</i> Sure, we used WKL in a nontrivial
way in the proof of LL, and vice versa, but formally defining "in a
nontrivial way" is difficult.  Ideally, we could worked in a setting
where WKL and LL are <i>not</i> theorems but their equivalence still holds.
In other words, if 𝒮 ⊬ WLK and 𝒮 ⊬ LL but 𝒮 ⊢ WLK ↔ LL, then we're
<i>guaranteed</i> to have used WKL and LL nontrivially in proving the
equivalence.
</p>

<p>
The system that's traditionally used which has this property is RCA₀,
a subsystem of second-order arithmetic whose universe of sets is
computable in a formal sense.  In order to define this subsystem, we
need to introduce the machinery of second-order arithmetic.

In this section, we're gonna do something kinda boring, we're gonna
give a specification of a logical language, like we do in intro logic
courses.  I hope that this can be skimmed by those familiar with the
concepts, and can be used as a more complete (albeit somewhat
pedantic) presentation of second-order arithmetic than is typically
given in (graduate) texts on reverse mathematics.

</table>

<p>
The subsystems we'll consider differ in their induction and
comprehension principles.  The restriction on these axiom schemas
comes from how "complex" of formulas we're allowed to use.
</p>

<p>
<b>Definition.</b> The ℱ-comprehension schema is the axiom schema
consisting formulas of the form
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
∃X.∀n(n ∈ X ↔ ϕ(n))
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
where ϕ ∈ ℱ.
</p>

<p>
<b>Definition.</b> The ℱ-induction schema is the axiom schema
consisting of formulas of the form
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
ϕ(0) ∧ ∀n.(ϕ(n) → ϕ(1 + n)) → ∀n.ϕ(n)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
where ϕ ∈ ℱ.
</p>

<p>
The question then is: <i>what does it mean for a formula to be more or
less complex?</i> Borrowing intuitions from computability theory, it
comes down to <i>quantifier alternation</i>. The reason for this is
deep<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup> but for our
purposes it's sufficient to recognize checking satisfiability of
∃-statements and unsatisfiability of ∀-statements amounts to a <i>search
problem</i>.  This, in essence, means that the satisfiability problem
becomes harder as you alternate quantifiers, which gives us a good
measure of formula complexity.
</p>

<p>
One caveat: if we're using difficulty of the satisfiability problem as
a measure of complexity, then quantifier-free is not the "least
complex" class of formulas. This is because we easily solve the satisfiability
problem for formulas with <i>bounded quantifiers</i>, i.e., when we know
exactly how much searching we need to do.  We'll use the following
notation for <i>bounded quantifiers</i>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
∀(n &lt; k).ϕ ≡ ∀n.(n &lt; k → ϕ)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
∃(n &lt; k).ϕ ≡ ∃n.(n &lt; k ∧ ϕ)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We define Σ⁰₀ = Π⁰₀ inductively:
</p>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">ϕ ∈ 𝔽 and ϕ is quantifier-free implies ϕ ∈ Σ⁰₀</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">ϕ ∈ Σ⁰₀ and x ∈ 𝕍 and k ∈ 𝕋 implies ∀(x &lt; k).ϕ ∈ Σ⁰₀</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">ϕ ∈ Σ⁰₀ and x ∈ 𝕍 and k ∈ 𝕋 implies ∃(x &lt; k).ϕ ∈ Σ⁰₀</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
In other words, we close under bounded-quantifiers. This class of
formulas has the property that the satisfaction problem is computable
(and with a fairly predictable running time).  For example
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
∃k &lt; (1 + n).(k * m = n)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
is a formula in Σ⁰₀ which expresses that m divides n. Note that we
don't have to search above n for the value of k such that k * m = n,
since n ≤ n * m when m &gt; 0.
</p>

<p>
We define the sets Σ⁰ᵢ₊₁ and Π⁰ᵢ₊₁ inductively:
</p>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">ϕ ∈ Π⁰ᵢ and x ∈ 𝕍  implies ∃x.ϕ ∈ Σ⁰ᵢ₊₁</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">ϕ ∈ Σ⁰ᵢ and x ∈ 𝕍  implies ∀x.ϕ ∈ Π⁰ᵢ₊₁</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
For example, a formula in Π⁰₅ is of the form ∀x.∃y.∀z.∃w.∀q.ϕ where ϕ
has only bounded quantifiers.
</p>

<p>
All of this is in the interests of (this corollary of) Post's
Theorem.<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
<b>Theorem.</b> A set 𝑋 is computably enumerable if and only if it is
definable by a Σ⁰₁ formula and is computable if it is also definable
by a Π⁰₁ formula.
</p>

<p>
This theorem connects definability with computability. Sets which are
definable by both a Σ⁰ᵢ and a Π⁰ᵢ formula are called Δ⁰ᵢ. These set
classifications are part of what is called the <i>arithmetic hierarchy</i>,
another term worth searching if you're interested in the connections
between computability and definability.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org524c72d">
<p>
The last thing we need to define RCA₀ is a special form of
comprehension.
</p>

<p>
<b>Definition.</b> The Δ⁰ᵢ-comprehension schema is the axiom schema
consisting formulas of the form
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
∀n.(ϕ(n) ↔ ψ(n)) → ∃X.∀n(n ∈ X ↔ ϕ(n))
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
where ϕ ∈ Σ⁰ᵢ and ψ ∈ Π⁰ᵢ.
</p>

<p>
You may be thinking: <i>why can't we define Δ⁰ᵢ-comprehension as a
ℱ-comprehension schema like above?</i> This is because Δ⁰ᵢ is not a set
of formulas, where as Σ⁰ᵢ and Π⁰ᵢ are.
</p>


<p>
Finally, we have enough machinery to define RCA₀:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
RCA₀ ≡ ℬ + Σ⁰₁-induction + Δ⁰₁-comprehension
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In light of the discussion above, this means RCA₀ is the subsystem of
second-order arithmetic in which we can do comprehension for
<i>computable sets</i> and induction for singly-existential statements.
