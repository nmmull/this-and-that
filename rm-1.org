These are notes for the first session of an informal seminar on
reverse mathematics at Boston University.  They're pretty rough and
hand-wavy, but I wanted to make sure those who attended have access.
* Three Perspectives
1. as a general concept

2. as a field of mathematics

3. as an explanatory mechanism for foundations
* The Concept
"What are the appropriate axioms for mathematics?"  (Simpson)

"When a theorem is proved from the right axioms, the axioms can be
  proved from the theorem." (Friedman)

The "reversal" of a theorem is the proof of the axioms from a theorem
* The Reversal
If 𝒯 ⊬ 𝑃 and 𝒯 ⊬ ¬𝑃 and 𝒯 ⊬ 𝑄 and 𝒯 + 𝑃 ⊢ 𝑄, then the proof of 𝑄 must
use 𝑃 nontrivially

*Example:*
+ ZF + Choice ⊢ Zorn's Lemma
+ ZF + Zorn's Lemma ⊢ Choice

We see this result in most undergraduate textbooks on abstract algebra
* A Key Point (in my opinion)
More than anything, the reversal is /fun/

Reverse mathematics is about doing math with your hands
tied behind your back

Hilbert calls the set theoretic world "paradise"

Shore calls the reverse mathematical world a "playground"
* Example (Slicing the Truth)
*Weak König's Lemma:* Every infinite binary tree has an infinite path

*Linndenbaum's Lemma:* Every consistent set of sentences has a
complete consistent extension

Weak König's lemma captures the /combinatorial core/ of Linndenbaum's
lemma
* Independence Results

There's natural connection to independence:

#+begin_quote
If 𝒯 ⊬ 𝑃 and 𝒯 ⊬ ¬𝑃, then 𝒯 is a reasonable place to
compare 𝑃 with other principles
#+end_quote
* Key Question
/How do we choose 𝒯, our BASE system?/
* A Bit of History

* RM as a Mathematical Field
Reverse mathematics is a young fields with a long prehistory

It develops at the confluence of arithmetization and computable
counterexamples

"Standard" RM is a field of computability/definability theory with
flavors of descriptive set theory
* What is our base system?
"Which set existence axioms are needed to prove the theorems of
ordinary mathematics?" (Simpson)

In "standard" RM, base systems are subsystems of second order
arithmetic with weakened set existence axioms

Particularly comprehension and induction
* Second Order Arithmetic
Two-sorted language which is "standard" arithmetic" + Set variables
and ∈ predicate

*PA (w.o. Ind):*
+ 1 + n ≠ 0
+ 1 + m = 1 + n → m = n
+ 0 + m = m
+ (1 + m) + n = 1 + (m + n)
+ 0 × m = 0
+ (1 + m) × n = n + (m × n)
+ ¬(m < 0)
+ m < n + 1 ↔ (m < n ∨ m = n)

*2nd Ord. Ind:* ∀X[(0 ∈ X ∧ ∀n[n ∈ X → 1 + n ∈ X]) → ∀n(n ∈ X)]

*BASE:* PA (w.o. Ind) + 2nd Ord. Ind

*Π¹∞-Comprehension (scheme):* ∃X ∀n(n ∈ X ↔ ϕ(n))

/Note:/ X cannot appear free in ϕ

*Full second order arithemtic (Z₂ or Π¹∞-CA):* BASE + Π¹∞-CA

* Model Theory
*Definition.* A *model* of a subsystem of second order arithemtic is:

#+begin_quote
(X, 𝒳 ⊂ 𝒫(X), 0ₓ, 1ₓ, +ₓ, ×ₓ, <ₓ)
#+end_quote

Different subsystems allow for different "universes" in the second
order part
* The Big Five
PRA (primitive recursive arithemtic)

1. RCA₀ (recursive comprehension)
2. WKL₀ ≡ RCA₀ + WKL (weak König's lemma)
3. ACA₀ (arithmetic comprehension)
4. ATR₀ (arithemtic transfinite recursion)
5. Π¹₁-CA (Π¹₁ comprehension)

Z₂ ≡ Π¹∞-CA (full second order arithmetic)
* The Big Five (Foundations)
PRA (finitism)

1. RCA₀ (computable mathematics)
2. WKL₀ ≡ RCA₀ + WKL (finitistic reductionism)
3. ACA₀ (predicatism)
4. ATR₀ (predicative reductionism)
5. Π¹₁-CA (impredicativity)

Z₂ ≡ Π¹∞-CA (full second order arithmetic)
* The Big Five (Theorems)
1. RCA₀ (intermediate value theorem)
2. WKL₀ ≡ RCA₀ + WKL (completeness, compactness)
3. ACA₀ (Balzano/Weirstrass)
4. ATR₀ (comparing well-orderings)
5. Π¹₁-CA (Cantor/Benixson)
* Philosophical Footnote
  The big five paint a convenient picture, it fits nicely
  into the history of foundational systems

  The picture has become more complicated over the years...

  The big five satisfy certain "robustness" properties

  *Question:* Is the "big five" an interesting phenomenon? Why or why
   not?
* RCA₀: Computable Mathematics
Gödel's theorems and independence theorems have lead to a
study of computable mathematical structures

*Definition.* An ω-model is a model whose first order part is the
standard natural numbers

*Theorem.* ℳ is a ω-model of RCA₀ if and only if its 2nd order part is
a Turing Ideal (closed under reducibility and joins)

The minimal ω-model for RCA₀ has the computable sets as its second
order part
* Hilbert's Program Revisited
Primitive recursive arithmetic (PRA) is quantifer free arithmetic +
primitive recursive functions

Tait argues that PRA capture "finitistic" arguments

PA ⊢ Con(PRA) and Z₂ ⊢ Con(PA) but Gödel's theorems tell use the that
we can't go the other way

*Question:* How much can we reduce mathematics to PRA?

*Theorem:* WKL₀ is Π₂ conservative over PRA:

#+begin_quote
If WKL₀ ⊢ ∀x∃yϕ(x, y) then PRA ⊢ ϕ(x, f(x)) for PR function f
#+end_quote

We can reduce theorems of this form all the way down to finitistic
reasoning
